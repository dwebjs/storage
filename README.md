## About The dWeb Protocol
dWeb is a protocol (dweb://) for the decentralized web and apart of the [Arisen](https://github.com/arisenio/technical-whitepaper) blockchain project. It is a p2p alternative to the HTTP (http://) protocol that also works alongside the HTTP protocol. dWeb is designed to share websites and web applications between peers of a peer-to-peer network, almost effortlessly through utilities like [dWeb CLI](https://github.com/dwebjs/cli) and [dBrowser](https://github.com/dbrowser/). dWeb is considered to be a key component of Web 4.0 and eliminates the need for web hosting altogether. You can read the dWeb protocol whitepaper [here](https://github.com/distributedweb/whitepaper).

## About dWebJS
dWebJS is the JavaScript implementation and reference implementation for dWeb 2.0. 

## Making History
dWebJS is the first published software ever written from a prison and apart of a growing movement to further prison reform in the United States. dWebJS was written without an IDE or any on-hand research tools. dWebJS is a combination of forked software libraries and custom software libraries that were written on notebook paper, prior to being sent to Peeps Labs for publishing. All software research and development was completed through a federal email system known as CORRLINKS, where there are no `copy` or `paste` capabilities. Inmates in federal prisons do not have the ability to search the web or view websites. dWebJS' software made its way to the web through the original contributor's collaboration with outside developers, as well as Peeps Labs. Peeps Labs now maintains development of dWebJS.
